# Vector-space-model-Recommendation-system

When you find something that you like - whether it is a poem, song, or image, it’s often useful to have an option to find similar items, such that you can enjoy songs of the same kind, for example. For this there exist recommender systems, and we will build one today. Given a dataset on nutrition of some products, you will be able to search for similar ones, e.g. for replacement in your daily meal: what if you don’t have good asparagus in Innopolis?

The recommender system will be based on the vector-space model + dimensionality reduction + cosine similarity measure.
